## AirBnB clone

The goal of this project is to deploy on my own server a simple copy of the [AirBnB website](https://www.airbnb.com/). However, not all features will be implemented.

The complete web application will be composed by:
- A command interpreter to manipulate data without a visual interface (perfect for development and debugging)
- A website (the front-end) that shows the final product to everybody: static and dynamic
- A database or files that store data (data = objects)
- An API that provides a communication interface between the front-end and your data (retrieve, create, delete, update them)

This repository implements only the command interpreter.
